\section[The results of all quality and time measurements (provide information about the
PC configuration used in order to put the time measurements in context).]{}

\subsection{Timings explained}
Both the simple and complex error pattern are used for the beowulf sequence.
The conceal time is calculated by timing each frame, the sum of these times is then divided by the amount of missing frames. Note that we calculate the average time it takes to conceal a frame, not the time it takes to load a frame.

\subsection{Setup}
PC Configuration used for the measurements: an Intel i5, 2 cores, 4 threads @2.5ghz with 8GB dual-channel DDR3 @798Mhz RAM. The GPU is an Integrated Intel Hd graphics 4600 + NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M (2048MB dedicated RAM). The HD is a 700GB SATA-III 5400 RPM.

\subsection{Results}
A comprehensive table with the timings, PSNR and SSIM values is included in appendix \ref{Q3:timings}. The results will be further explained in question 4.
